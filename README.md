This repository demonstrates a common issue with nested routes in React Router v6 and its solution.  The initial `App.js` shows the problem where nested routes within a parent route fail to render.  The solution is provided in `AppSolution.js`, showcasing the correct usage of nested routes using the `useParams` hook and the `Outlet` component.  This should help developers understand and avoid this frequent error.
